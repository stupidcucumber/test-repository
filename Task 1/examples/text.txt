I want to break free, Everest!
Nestled in the heart of the Rockies, Mount Celestia stands as a majestic sentinel, its snow-capped peak touching the sky.
The formidable Mount Embercore, with its rugged slopes and ancient glaciers, dominates the landscape of the northern wilderness.
Hidden among the clouds, the elusive Azure Peak boasts breathtaking vistas and is revered by mountaineers seeking the ultimate alpine challenge.
Some mountains were formed by the activity of volcanoes. 
Scientists believe that most volcanic mountains are made up of rock that melted deep within Earth. 
The rock rose through Earth's surface, or crust. It then flowed onto the surface in the form of lava. 
The lava, along with volcanic dust, built up to form mountains. 
Volcanic mountains are typically steep and cone shaped. 
Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Mount Rainier in the United States are examples of volcanic mountains.
Other mountains were formed by movements within Earth's surface, or crust. 
The theory called plate tectonics explains this type of mountain building. 
Earth's surface is divided into huge pieces called plates, which move very slowly. 
The continents sit on top of the plates and move with them. 
At times the plates collide, forcing the rock upward. 
The Himalayas of Asia are an example of this type of mountain chain. 
They were formed when a plate carrying India collided with the Asian plate.

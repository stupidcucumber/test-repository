# About this folder
For convenience I've created this folder and put some code in it. Specifically, `gen_magic_point_dataset.py` – is a script, that unpacks all .tar files of synthetic dataset and generated .csv file for futher training of MagicPoint.

# MagicPoint
Dataset contains point, where each point is in (y, x) format.

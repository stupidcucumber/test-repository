# Precautions for the environment

There is a package called `glob`, which has changed since python 3.10. My source code extensively use this package for monitoring failes and taking control dataset files. However, my code works only with `glob` from Python 3.11. Due to this problem, I suggest installing Python 3.11.6 which perfectly runs all the code on my machine, and hopefuly on yours.
